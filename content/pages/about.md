My name is James and I am currently employed as a DevOps engineer in Sydney, Australia. My work days and a great deal of my spare time are spent making, breaking and fixing things both inside and outside the realm of technology.

Through all of this I learn a lot and The Jimternet is a place for me to share knowledge that I gather through my experiences. I hope that you find it useful.
