My name is James Stewart. I'm a music-lover, home-brewer, husband, father, maker and long-time technology enthusiast.

An IT professional since around the time the [Millenium Bug][Millenium Bug] was causing a fuss, I currently work remotely from my base on Australia's New South Wales Central Coast as an Open Source Software Developer and DevOps Engineer. Previously I specialised in Linux and Monitoring but these days I'd rather just be coding in Python.

My work days and a great deal of my spare time are spent making, breaking and fixing things both inside and outside the realm of technology. The Jimternet is a place for me to share what I learn along the way.
