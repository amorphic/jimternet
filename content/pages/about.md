My name is James Stewart. I'm a music-lover, home-brewer, husband, father, maker and long-time technologist.

![James][James]

An IT professional since the era when the [Millenium Bug][Millenium Bug] was causing a fuss, I work remotely from my base on Australia's New South Wales Central Coast as an Open Source Software Developer and DevOps Engineer. Previously I specialised in Linux and Monitoring and more recently I've focussed on Python, React, 3D Printing and the Internet Of Things.

I am the co-founder of technology consultancy [Amorphitec][Amorphitec], makerspace [SparkCC][SparkCC] and customised prop purveyors [Enstaved][Enstaved].

My work days and a great deal of my spare time are spent making, breaking and fixing things both inside and outside the realm of technology. The Jimternet is a place for me to share what I learn along the way.
