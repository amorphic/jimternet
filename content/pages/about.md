Slug: about

My name is James Stewart. I'm a music-lover, home-brewer, husband, father and long-time technology enthusiast. An IT professional for over a decade, I am currently employed as a Devops Engineer in Sydney, Australia where I specialise in Linux, Python and Monitoring.

My work days and a great deal of my spare time are spent making, breaking and fixing things both inside and outside the realm of technology. The Jimternet is a place for me to share what I learn along the way.
