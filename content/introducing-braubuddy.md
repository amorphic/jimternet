Today I'm very pleased to make available the first beta release of [Braubuddy][braubuddy.org].

![Braubuddy Dashboard][]<!--more--> 

Braubuddy started as a simple Python script to monitor the fermentation temperature of my home brew using a [Raspberry Pi][] and a USB thermometer.

Since then the project has evolved into a fully-featured and extensible temperature management framework. I trust that Braubuddy will prove useful to other brewers and indeed anybody with a requirement for precise temperature control.

Visit [braubuddy.org][] for more details.
