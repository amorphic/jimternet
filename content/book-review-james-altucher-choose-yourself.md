![Choose Yourself][]

On the evening that I finished reading James Altucher's new book *Choose
Yourself*, the nightly news lead with the story of [260 employees at
Target's Geelong headquarters being made redundant][Target].

Footage showed these newly-unemployed leaving what used to be their
place of work. Most were visibly upset, many were crying and some
stopped to express their frustration to waiting reporters:

> "I can't actually believe it's happened. I've worked my whole life
> since I was 15. I've never lost a job. And I've got a mortgage to pay
> and, you know, all the bills to pay. I need a job."

> "I moved down to Geelong specifically to put my heart and soul into
> Target and this is how you get rewarded, so it is disappointing, yes."

Only weeks earlier Ford announced the closure of its Australian plants,
a decision set to cost 1200 workers their jobs. More recently, [IBM][]
and [several others][] have announced mass-redundancies as Australia's
burgeoning economy finally enters its inevitable slowdown.

Economic cycles are nothing new and organisations will inevitably hire
in good times and fire in bad. However the Information Age has rendered
many of the old paradigms of employment obsolete for both employers and
employees alike. Those who fail to adapt may well be left behind, but a
new age of opportunity beckons for those willing to embrace a fresh
approach.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

In *Choose Yourself*, James Altucher implores the reader to reconsider
everything that they've been taught about education, career and how to
make one's way in the modern world.

James is a highly successful individual, at least for most commonly-held
definitions of "successful". By most accounts he is highly intelligent
and independently wealthy, having built up and sold various businesses
from scratch. He is a chess grandmaster, a prolific author, (*Choose
Yourself* is his eleventh book) and a sought-after public speaker who
apparently counts celebrities and other persons of influence as friends
and acquaintances.

And yet at various times in his life, James has also been an abject
failure: bankrupt, unemployed, divorced, addicted and utterly depressed.
He is by his own admission a flawed individual and in a refreshing
departure from the egocentricity of the average would-be life coach,
James describes himself as entirely '[mediocre][]'.

Part auto-biography, part self-help manual, *Choose Yourself* is James's
idea of an alternative path to success, fulfillment and happiness. It is
the means by which a 'mediocre' individual such as himself might eschew
the supposed security of a traditional career for the boundless
possibilities that only become apparent when one takes responsibility
for one's own destiny. And with companies increasingly turning to temp
staff, outsourcing and automation to reduce headcount, James argues that
Choosing Yourself is quickly becoming less an option and more
a necessity.

To some extent most of us live according to these 'rules', perpetuated
by both the well-meaning **and** the self-serving. Certainly, the
realisation that we are programmed from an early age to attend school,
obtain qualifications, seek work with an established institution and
ultimately become shackled to this work through debt is nothing new.

In *Choose Yourself*, James argues compellingly that these rules are
irrelevant in an information economy, where data is king and change is
an integral part of professional life. Individuals or small enterprises
are no longer beholden to large organisations: if one has a valuable
skill or service to offer, free or inexpensive tools now exist to learn,
develop, self-promote, produce and publish:

-   <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">An
    inexpensive laptop now has enough power for a graphic designer to
    create anything. They can sell their services via an online
    marketplace like [Freelancer][].</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">A group of
    geographically-disparate software developers can collaborate on a
    project using [Github][]. When they're ready to go live, they can
    host their new service in the cloud for next to nothing.</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">There are
    enough free [Youtube][] tutorial videos to learn the basics of just
    about any skill imaginable. Forget teachers, courses, books and
    money. All you need is time.</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Anybody can
    design anything in 3d using open source, (free) tools such as
    [Blender][]. They can sell real, physical copies of their new widget
    via a 3d printing service such as [Shapeways][].</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">A writer
    can self-publish articles via a blog, or entire books via
    [Amazon][]. In fact, this is exactly what James has done.</span>

Of course it goes against our very nature to break free of what James
refers to as the '[prison][]' of a traditional career path. First we
must realise that the prison does not exist, that it is entirely of our
own making. James offers reams of advise to aid in *Choosing Yourself*
and making this transition, some examples being:

**Have ideas**

Great products and services are born of great ideas. But great ideas
don't just happen, they are the product of a creative mindset. James
[suggests][] that the ability to generate ideas is like a muscle which
grows stronger with use, but similarly atrophies with neglect. To build
this 'idea muscle', try to write down 10 new ideas every single day.
They don't all have to be world-beaters and it may be months before the
ideas begin to flow easily, but it will happen.

**Forget about 'purpose'**

When considering a change in direction, many people focus on finding
their 'purpose in life'. James debunks this notion, arguing instead that
life is an ongoing sequence of experiences, with the lessons learned
from each contributing to those subsequent . Countless individuals who
are considered to have been "successful" only achieved that for which
they are most known after [following various paths throughout their
lives][].

> "The idea of a 'purpose' is a myth. There is no purpose, no
> be-all-and-end-all after which we will just stop."
>
> --James Altucher, recent interview with [Lifehacker.com][]

**Give nobody the ability to ruin your life**

Most of us live in a somewhat tenuous position, whereby a single
decision made by one of a number of people, (an employer, an important
client, a bank manager) can impart a hugely negative impact on our
lives. This is an unhealthy situation. Instead, James suggests that one
should aim to have a number of 'irons in the fire' such that if one
fails, the impact may be absorbed by the others.

**Follow the 'Daily Practice'**

At the core of all else is what James refers to as [The Daily
Practice][]. That is, to ensure each and every day that we remain
healthy in 4 distinct ways: physically, emotionally, mentally and
spiritually. This may seem obvious, but a busy lifestyle can quickly
lead us to neglect these key areas at the times when [we should be
focussing on them most][]:

> One time Gandhi said to a group of his backers, “I need to set aside
> one hour a day to do meditation.”
>
> One of the backers said, “oh no, you can’t do that! You are too busy,
> Gandhi!”
>
> Gandhi said, “Well, then, I now need to set aside two hours a day to
> do meditation.”

*Choose Yourself* is presented in James' entertaining and highly
readable style, with points backed by personal experience and fleshed
out with anecdotes. He seems to be genuinely motivated by the desire to
change the way people think and the ratio of interesting, useful content
to padding is significantly higher than in most 'self-help' books that
I've encountered.

The content does feel disjointed in places, but if *Choose Yourself*
occasionally reads like a series of blog posts, that's because it is
essentially just that. In fact those unfamilar with James' writing
should go directly to [jamesaltucher.com][], where many of the chapters
are published and free to read.

If these posts resonate with you as they did with me, I highly recommend
that you go on to read *Choose Yourself*. It is [available on
amazon.com][] as an ebook for the princely sum of US\$4.99 and if you're
still not convinced, James has offered to [refund the purchase price][],
(or donate it to charity, should you prefer). You can't say fairer than
that.
