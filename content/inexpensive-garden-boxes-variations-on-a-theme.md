Previously I authored a post describing [how to build inexpensive garden boxes from fence palings][inexpensive boxes]. In it I mentioned that the basic design could be altered to create boxes of different shapes and sizes. With Spring well and truly underway our garden has been a hive of activity and I've been busy creating new beds to fit in various spots around our backyard.

The size and shape of the first of these boxes was dictated by the raw materials. In this case timber salvaged from an old pallet:

Not having to pay for the timber made these boxes very inexpensive indeed! Some short work with a wrecking bar and a drop saw resulted in a solid square garden box:

Another set of boxes began as a pair of small garden beds for my son and daughter. These were just a scaled-down version of the original design, measuring 900mm x 600mm and only 2 palings high:

In the end I got a little over-zealous and cut enough timber to make 5 of these:

They do a great job of lining the outer wall of my workshop while providing a whole bunch of new planting space!
