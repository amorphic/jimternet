Introducing... **The Pythonic Staff of Enlightenment**:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The Python Staff of Enlightenment is the perfect companion for [Pythonistas][Pythonista] as they spread [The Zen of Python][The Zen of Python].

The idea for the staff came to me while looking for something Pythonic to print for my upcoming PyCon AU talk [Controlling a 3D Printer with Python][PyCon AU 3D Printing]. Searching Thingiverse for [Python-related models][Python Thingiverse] yielded a few results but nothing that really grabbed me.

Later while searching for props for my kids' *Elves and Fairies*-themed birthday party I came across some quarterstaff models and I wondered if I could somehow create one that was topped by the Python logo...

The answer was no. With my limited CAD skills I could not. Fortunately my friend Ben of [Eurekaman Designs][Eurekaman Designs] has almost *un*limited CAD skills. So on a visit to [SparkCC][SparkCC] I presented the concept to him and he promised to get back to me with a design.

Soon after I had not one but *two* designs to choose from!

It wasn't long before the final tweaks were applied and the first section of the Pythonic Staff of Enlightenment was emerging from my 3d printer:

The staff is printed in sections which screw together thanks to Ben's handy threaded design. He had suggested a little glue might be necessary but nope - the pieces fit snugly without being too tight.

I was so happy with the finished result I couldn't resist taking it out into the garden for some glamour shots.

I'll have the Pythonic Staff of Enlightenment with me at PyCon AU for any Aussie Pythonistas who'd like to see it in the flesh. Better yet if you have access to a 3d printer grab the models from [Thingiverse][Pythonic Staff Thingiverse] and print one out for yourself!
