With the 2016 school year drawing to a close my daughter and I were looking for something interesting and fun to give out to her classmates with their Christmas cards.

As further evidence of the fact that *3D Printing is Awesome* I give you...

...the 3D-printed __Build Your Own Snowman__ kit!

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This clever little model was created by the people at [Makerbot][Makerbot] and made available for free download on [Thingiverse][Snowman Thingiverse].

Having run out of white PLA filament printing the __Yuletide Staff of Festivity__ for [Enstaved][Enstaved] I decided to have another go at printing with a roll of white ABS I picked up a while back but ultimately gave up on.

Employing the excellent [ABS Puck Method][ABS Puck Method] I managed to get solid adhesion to the print bed and before long I had a small army of rather menacing-looking Snowmen on my workbench:

With the addition of their hats these little guys started to look a little friendlier:

Printing the orange carrot noses proved a little problematic as such tiny parts are difficult to get stuck to the print bed. In the end I found printing them in rows with a relatively large brim did the trick:

By comparison the twig arms printed much easier than I had expected:

Each snowman kit was individually bagged and as a finishing touch I added a label giving a clue as to how the completed kit should look:

Apparently the kids in my daughter's class were quite thrilled by these, so Mission Accomplished. The snowman kits would also make a great trinket to put inside some home-made Christmas crackers, something I'll probably do for Christmas 2017.

3D Printing - bringing a little magic to the holiday season!
