Posts to The Jimternet have been a little thin on the ground in recent months. Of the myriad reasons behind this shortage of missives, one of the most exciting is the birth of SparkCC.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

SparkCC is a [makerspace/hackerspace][wikipedia hackerspace] located on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. It is the brainchild of a number of like-minded individuals, most notably our Vice-President Hannes who first raised the idea of creating a 'space on the Central Coast several years ago.

After months of hard work by all concerned I'm pleased to say that we are now a [legitimate entity][sparkcc official] and our doors are open to all Central Coast makers! We have a fantastic, well-appointed space with a growing inventory of tools and equipment and our membership is evolving into a diverse community of makers with a broad variety of interests and skillsets.

Already we count amongst our number talented makers with backgrounds in such wide-ranging fields as electrical engineering, drum making, software development, visual arts and prop/costume fabrication. To say that so many disciplines cross-pollinating under one roof is an exciting prospect is something of an understatement!

I have the honour of being the first holder of the office of SparkCC President and I have no doubt that our makerspace is poised to become a hub of innovation and creativity on the Central Coast. If you love making things or you're interested in learning how to make things follow us on [Facebook][sparkcc facebook], sign up to our [mailing list][sparkcc mailing list], check out our [website][sparkcc website] and above all come along to SparkCC and meet some like-minded makers!
